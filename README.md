# vThermostat-Celsius-
Virtual Thermostat For Hubitat (Celsius Version)

This project is essentially a modification of vThermostat by Josh208 to use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.  I have very little knowledge of coding in Groovy, but I do have some basic programming knowledge.  That being said, if this doesn't work as expected, it is unlikely to get fixed without help from someone more knowledgeable than me.
